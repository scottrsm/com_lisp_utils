   
Discussion of effect of setting a modulus on the polynomial calculations:

1).
A modulus may be set which is a positive integer greater than 1.
The effect on subsequent mathematical operations will be to mod
all the resulting coefficients by this value. This includes real and
complex coefficients. Also, the simplification X^mod = X can be used if
mod is prime. This simplification will be used if when setting the 
modulus the keyword :prime is true in the call to set-modulus.
Example:  
> set-modulus 11 :field? t
 This sets the modulus to 11 and tells the simplification software to 
 use the simplification X^11 = X. This makes sense when the coefficients
 in the polynomials considered are integers. The user may also want
 this effect in the case when the coefficients are real or complex.
 For instance, the user may wish to consider variables take values in 
 Z mod 11, while the coefficients takes values in the real or complex
 numbers (mod 11). The default value of :field? in set-modulus is nil.
 So, even if the modulus is prime, you must tell the software with this
 keyword that it is ok to use the simplification X^mod = X.

NOTE: X mod p is a field if and only if p is prime.


2).
If a polynomial is created with a modulus (nil or otherwise) and the the 
modulus is set to another integer, then polynomial will display itself 
using the new modulus. If the modulus is returned to the value used to 
create the polynomial, the polynomial will display itself as it did originally.


3).
NOTE: If computations seem to give the wrong answer, check the state of the 
system with (rsm.mpoly:report-state).
