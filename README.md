## Common Lisp Utilities


### Description
This repo consists of a number of mini-projects covering a variety of topics.
The intent was to use lisp to examine these topics and create modules that could
be reused. The code was developed using the S(teel)B(ank)C(ommon)L(isp) lisp compiler
and the ASDF package builder.
